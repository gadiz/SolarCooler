A photoresistor or light dependent resistor (LDR) is a resistor whose
resistance decreases with increasing incident light intensity; in other
words, it exhibits photoconductivity.
The lux (symbol: lx) is the SI unit of illuminance and luminous emittance,
measuring luminous flux per unit area.
This library implements a way to estimate lux given a LDR resistance value
read from an ADC input pin of an AVR Atmega.
The estimation is based on this forumla:
lux = A*((R/B)^C)
where R is the LDR resistance.
An Excel spreadsheet is provided to help the estimation of A, B and C values
You have to read lux values using a calibrated luxmeter, and R values of your
LDR, write it down on the Excel sheet, and estimate A, B and C.


Devel Notes
-----------
This library was developed on Eclipse, built with avr-gcc on Atmega8 @ 1MHz.
